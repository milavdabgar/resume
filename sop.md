**Statement of Purpose**

**Milav Jayeshkumar Dabgar**

AICTE Industry Fellowship Application – 2025

------

My engineering journey began with a deep-rooted curiosity about how things work—a habit of dismantling toys as a child transformed into a lifelong pursuit of building and optimizing real systems. This hands-on inclination led me to pursue a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and kick-start my career in the R&D division of a Japan-based firm, where I managed end-to-end electronics development for commercial embedded products. Working directly on circuit simulation, PCB design, firmware development, and control systems gave me a strong foundation not only in hardware but in the systems-thinking approach that connects devices to intelligent behavior.

In 2016, I transitioned into academics and have since been serving as a Lecturer at Government Polytechnic, Palanpur. Over these years, my technical interests evolved beyond embedded systems toward software engineering, artificial intelligence, and data-driven automation. I complemented this transition by completing over 100 online courses and enrolling in the **BS in Data Science and Applications** from **IIT Madras**, where I’ve earned the **Diploma in Programming** and am one project away from completing the **Diploma in Data Science**. This experience gave structure and depth to my evolving interest in AI, web development, and applied machine learning.

In my teaching role, I engage with students not just in classrooms but also through hands-on innovation. I have mentored several project teams working in IoT, drones, and embedded automation. One of these efforts resulted in two student patents—one of which received over ₹25 lakhs in funding from Shark Tank India and another ₹20 lakhs through government innovation support. Beyond teaching, I contribute to institutional development as the **IT Convener**, **SSIP Co-Convener**, **Training & Placement Member**, and part of our **MIS and UDAYAM initiative teams**. These responsibilities reflect my ability to coordinate across departments, lead technical initiatives, and foster a culture of innovation.

To address gaps in academic systems, I initiated and now lead the development of a **Next.js-based smart academic portal**—an in-house solution offering smart attendance tracking, assessment workflows, committee and profile management, automated result processing, and real-time feedback analytics. The system is developed collaboratively with student contributions through Git, and is deployed using a self-hosted Linux server stack with Dockerized services, CI/CD pipelines, and backup infrastructure—all managed by myself. This project reflects not only my full-stack and infrastructure expertise, but also my dedication to real-world, scalable solutions that blend software, operations, and educational workflows.

These cumulative experiences—spanning electronics, data systems, AI/ML practices, and full-stack engineering—have shaped me into a hands-on, self-motivated, and systems-oriented engineer-educator. I believe the Industry Fellowship offers a transformative platform to further this trajectory by immersing myself in applied industrial research, working on real-world challenges in areas such as edge intelligence, backend optimization, or AI system integration. The opportunity to collaborate with industry professionals and researchers will expose me to high-performance team dynamics, product-oriented development cycles, and problem-solving frameworks beyond the academic context.

Long-term, I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in the fields of AI, embedded computing, or system design from a premier institution. I see this fellowship as a bridge to that goal—a chance to bring industrial rigor into my academic evolution. More importantly, I aim to channel this experience back into the diploma-level ecosystem in Gujarat, which, in my view, holds vast untapped potential for innovation and research-driven education. As a faculty leader already involved in SSIP and IT strategy, I’m committed to shaping student initiatives, research culture, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

I am confident that my technical depth, academic versatility, leadership experience, and motivation for continuous learning align well with the goals of the Industry Fellowship. I look forward to contributing meaningfully while growing professionally and academically through this opportunity.
